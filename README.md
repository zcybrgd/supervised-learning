# supervised-learning
this is the repo where there is all my notebooks and ml algorithms during my learning of supervised learning, i explored a lot of datasets to predict several labels, including salary datasets, 
a dataset related to student performance, and even a NASA JPL Asteroid Dataset etc .. /datasets/ were brought from Kaggle

# what you can find : 
- built a single variable linear regression model to predict the salary of an employee based on their years of experience
- predicting performance index of students based on many features related to their Study Habits and Activities (used model performance metrics such as R-squared and RMSE)
- predicting Fuel Efficiency (mpg) of Automobiles using Multiple Features (exploring Regularization on our Model with Ridge and Lasso)
- classifying asteroids which will help us eventually to identify their classes.
- a datacamp project: Classify Song Genres from Audio Data
- ....
